In this project the goal is simple. Take [Tensorflow Basic classification: Classify images of clothing guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) and write a classification class. Then expose it via an API (using Flask) and deploy it in a production environment (using Docker).

### Design
We can simplify the basic design like:
